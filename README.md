Tamagotchi App Report

This Tamagotchi app is a clone of a well-known 1990s virtual pet toy Tamagotchi. Its purpose is to allow its users to care for the virtual pet in a fun interactive way on their Android smartphones, imitating the original toy’s experience. The app stimulates the responsibility of pet ownership in a virtual way as the user must feed, clean after, and play with their virtual pet to therefore keep it entertained and healthy. This app encourages users to gain an understanding of the responsibility of caring for a pet.  
I fulfilled my objective by designing my very own Tamagotchi app. This app is aesthetically pleasing and has a very engaging user interface that will grab the attention of the user. Since this application is catered to a much younger demographic, I made sure to use the appropriate colours, images, fonts, and design schemes to attract the target audience. It features a welcome page that directs the users into the game, where they are able to feed, clean after, and play with their virtual pet, as they are also keeping a close eye on the pets’ health, hunger, and cleanliness status. 


The display of the app aims to be engaging and welcoming to the target audience, using bright colours and appropriate images which will create a fun, lively and playful atmosphere. The user interface embodies animations that have been customised specifically to match the actions of the pet, making the app livelier and more enjoyable. The layout is very descriptive and specific with a button on the first screen to firstly guide the user to the second screen and the second screen itself also has clearly labelled buttons for feeding, cleaning, and playing with the virtual pet. 
The Welcome Screen displays “Welcome to Baux Your Tamagotchi App”. The app itself features a virtual Dalmatian dog called Beaux as the virtual pet. When the user clicks the “Get Started” button the app will lead them to the second page. This is the page where the game is played and where the actions of the game will transpire.

Logic has been implemented on the welcome screen in the following ways. An image of the virtual pet has been displayed on this screen. Three buttons have been incorporated to represent the actions of feed, clean, and play. Therefore, when clicking on the “feed” button, the pet’s image changes to match the feeding action icon, and the pet's status is updated at the bottom. When clicking the “clean” button, the pet’s image changes to match the cleaning action icon and also updates the status values. When the user clicks on the “play” button, the pet’s image changes to match the playing action icon, and again should display the status values based on the action performed. Therefore, every action will affect the virtual pet’s status value, that is hunger, cleanliness, and happiness, which will be displayed to the user. These real-time status updates are displayed to show the pet’s changing needs, creating an atmosphere where the user can fully be immersed and engaged in the game.

Once my coding was completed and my app was running efficiently and effectively on the emulator, I moved on to version control with GitHub. I created a new repository for my project and then initialised my repository with a README file. Once that was completed, I committed and pushed my project files to the GitHub repository. At times when I was editing my code I would regularly commit and push my project files to GitHub.
Once version control was completed, I moved on to testing and automated testing. I thoroughly conducted manual testing to make sure that the app ran smoothly and provided an exciting and fun experience for the users. I made use of GitHub actions to run tests and when building my code, I made sure that it does not just work on my computer, but on an Android Smartphone as well. 
The Tamagotchi app is therefore designed to supply users with a fun and educational experience while also providing them with skills and knowledge about the responsibilities of caring for a pet. With the engaging User Interface (UI) design and careful consideration of the features, the app aims to give users an optimistic and gratifying user experience. The utilization of GitHub and GitHub actions ensured that the app was efficient and reliable allowing for high-quality development of the application and therefore allowing for a great user experience.
